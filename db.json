Such design was inspired by the seal used by Henry the Bearded, his father. Since then, the black eagle with a white (silver) crescent put across its wings, usually with a white (silver) cross pattée on top of it, placed in the yellow (golden) escutcheon (shield), had become the symbol of the Lower Silesia, including being the symbol of the Piast rulers of the Duchy of Silesia, and many of its successors",
