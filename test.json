Such design was inspired by the seal used by Henry the Bearded, his father. Since then, the black eagle with a white (silver) crescent put across its wings, usually with a white (silver) cross pattée on top of it, placed in the yellow (golden) escutcheon (shield), had become the symbol of the Lower Silesia, including being the symbol of the Piast rulers of the Duchy of Silesia, and many of its successors",

The area was originally a small western suburb of the town of Cieszyn, the capital of the Duchy of Cieszyn, which was established in 1290, during the fragmentation of Poland into smaller duchies. It was ruled by the Piast dynasty until 1653, and by the Habsburg dynasty afterwards. Under Austrian rule, it was known under its Germanized name Teschen. It was known for its national and cultural diversity, consisting mostly of German, Polish, Jewish and Czech communities. In 1849, the western part of Teschen was home to only 14.9% of the town's total population: in 1880 24% and in 1910 33.4%. There was also a small but lively Hungarian community in the town, mostly officers and administrative workers.",
